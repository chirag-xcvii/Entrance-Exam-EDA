# Entrance-Exam-EDA
**Overview**

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), analysis, and regression tasks on a dataset related to *college entrance exam scores*. The dataset contains information about students' performance in math and verbal sections of the exam, as well as various demographic and academic factors such as family income, academic subjects studied, and GPA.

*I have added additional columns such as political affiliation, region, population, and GDP per capita to enhance the analysis.*
